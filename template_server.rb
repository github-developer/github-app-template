# This is template code to create a GitHub App server.
# You can read more about GitHub Apps here: # https://developer.github.com/apps/
#
# On its own, this app does absolutely nothing, except that it can be installed.
# It's up to you to add functionality!
# You can check out one example in advanced_server.rb.
#
# This code is a Sinatra app, for two reasons:
#   1. Because the app will require a landing page for installation.
#   2. To easily handle webhook events.
#
# Of course, not all apps need to receive and process events!
# Feel free to rip out the event handling code if you don't need it.
#
# Have fun!

    # the signature sent in the `X-HUB-Signature-256` header. If they don't match,
    # this request is an attack, and you should reject it. GitHub uses the HMAC
    # hexdigest to compute the signature. The `X-HUB-Signature-256` looks something
    # like this: "sha256=123456".

  # Finally some logic to let us run this server directly from the command line,
  # or with Rack. Don't worry too much about this code. But, for the curious:
  # $0 is the executed file
  # __FILE__ is the current file
  # If they are the sameâ€”that is, we are running this file directly, call the
  # Sinatra run method
  run! if __FILE__ == $0
